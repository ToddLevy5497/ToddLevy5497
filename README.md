## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an NLP enthusiast passionate about turning unstructured text into structured insight. This repository is a reflection of my current exploration into two key areas of natural language processing: text summarization and text classification.

My work centers around building models and pipelines that can understand, distill, and categorize large volumes of text. Whether it's condensing articles into bite-sized summaries or automatically tagging content based on its themes, I'm fascinated by how machines can learn to interpret and organize language in meaningful ways.

In the realm of summarization, Iâ€™m experimenting with both extractive and abstractive approachesâ€”leveraging pre-trained models, fine-tuning transformers, and exploring how to strike the right balance between brevity and context. For classification, I'm focused on supervised learning techniques, multi-label tagging, and optimizing models for accuracy and generalization across diverse datasets.

This repository includes my latest projects, model experiments, and utility scripts that support the NLP workflows Iâ€™m developing. Youâ€™ll find examples of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and deployment-ready code, all aimed at making these techniques more accessible and reusable for other developers and researchers.

Iâ€™m always eager to learn and share what Iâ€™m discovering, so if youâ€™re working on something similarâ€”or just curious about NLPâ€”Iâ€™d love for you to check out the code, ask questions, or collaborate. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

Thanks for stopping by. Letâ€™s keep pushing the boundaries of what machines can understand. ðŸ§ ðŸ“„âœ¨
